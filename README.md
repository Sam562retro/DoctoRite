# DoctoRite
In our country and around the world, we observe more and more doctors and frontline workers being severely affected by extreme stress and mental health problems. 
“The doctors experienced considerable adverse mental health parameters evidenced by a relatively higher level of acute fatigue compared to chronic fatigue and inter shift recovery, but generally normal levels of depression, anxiety, and stress amid the COVID-19 pandemic. High work demands and poor recovery experiences are generally associated with poor mental health parameters; however, poor psychological detachment from work was associated with a better level of several mental health parameters. Future study is warranted to assess causality and evaluate the significant difference in the burden of mental health, work demands, and recovery experience parameters by comparing available data before and during the COVID-19 pandemic among the comparable study population.”

As found in many studies, connecting with people in a similar situation as yourself is beneficial to your mental health and others’ mental health as well. (Heller, Tamar, et al. "Benefits of support groups for families of adults with severe mental illness." American Journal of Orthopsychiatry 67.2 (1997): 187-198.)
Our solution DoctoRite aims to solve this rising problem in our post-pandemic society. We aim to connect doctors to other doctors and help them form mutual help groups so that they can connect with people in the same headspace. Doctors can create a profile and register an account. After which they will be able to display whether they are COVID positive or negative and their current health as well. Doctors can set certain times during which they will take appointments or visits. The doctor’s family can also check on the doctors who are kept under quarantine or out of the house due to their duties. Families can create a chat room for themselves where only the doctor and their family is present'
